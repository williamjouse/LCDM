In the code LCDM-SN.py is plotted the distance modulus using scipy.integrate.cumtrapz, scipy.integrate.quad and F2py implementations. The data considered were Patheon Sample. For F2py implementation, see the file SN.f.

In LCDM-BAO.py is the same as the previous one, but now is plotted the BAO angular scale measurements. For F2py implementation, see the file BAO2D.f.
