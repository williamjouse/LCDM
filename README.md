# LCDM-tests
This repository contains the codes to analyze the LambdaCDM model using the scipy.integrate.cumtrapz, scipy.integrate.quad and F2py implementations. 

The statistical analysis is achieved using pymultinest and confidence levels are obtained from Getdist.

In the code LCDM-SN.py is plotted the distance modulus using scipy.integrate.cumtrapz, scipy.integrate.quad and F2py implementations. The data considered was Patheon Sample. For F2py implementation, see the file SN.f.

In LCDM-BAO.py is the same of previous one, but now is plotted the BAO angular scale measurements. For F2py implementaion, see the file BAO2D.f.
