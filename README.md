# LCDM
This repository contains the codes to analyze the LambdaCDM model using the scipy.integrate.cumtrapz, scipy.integrate.quad and F2py implementations.

The statistical analysis is achieved using pymultinest and confidence levels are obtained from Getdist, see the statistical-codes directory. We ran the code five times for SNeIa and BAO2D. The results, parameter mean/error, and Bayesian evidence are in a folder named chains, and the time run we show in the time.txt file.
